    "* Statistics is the science of evaluating population parameters using sample estimates. The word *parameter* comes from Greek and means \"beyond measure\". Populations of interest cannot be evauated directly and, hence, the need for statistics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An important statistic is *mean*, which provides a central tendency of the population. Mean provides a typical value and is used to estimate the population average. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean alone does not provide an adequate summary statistic. Consider the claim of a fictious matchbox company called *Matchless Matches* that advertises its matchboxes as having 48 matches on average. You buy 6 matchboxes from this company and find that they contain 48, 49, 49, 47, 48 and 47 matches. So far so good. Another matchbox company, *Mighty Matches*, also claims to make matchboxes with 48 matches on average per matchbox. Again, you buy six matches from this company and find that they contain 12, 62, 3, 50, 93 and 68 matches, which average to 48. However, the number of matches in *Mighty Matches'*s case vary a lot. Another statistic is required to capture this type of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One way of measuring variation in data is by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value in the data. This statistic is known as range. The range in the sample matchboxes of <i>Matchless Matches</i> was (49 - 47 = ) 2 and (93 - 12 =) 81 in those of <i>Mighty Matches</i>. However, range only uses 2 data points from the sample. It would be better if all the data points in the sample could be used, just as in the case of mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If all the matchboxes from the above examples had 48 matches, which happens to be the mean in both examples, then there would be no variation. Hence, one way of calculating variation is by finding out how much each matchbox deviates from the mean and adding them. This would also show the contribution of each matchbox to the total variation."

    "* There are 2 issues with total deviation as calculated above. First, it depends on sample size (<i>n</i>). As the sample size grows, so does total variation. That means only variations derived from equal-sized samples can be compared, unlike mean. Second, negative and positive deviations from the mean, when summed, cancel each other out, masking the true magnitude of variation in the data, as happened in the above examples when absolute values of the deviations from the mean were not taken.\n",
